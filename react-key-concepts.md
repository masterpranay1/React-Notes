Created: January 20, 2022 10:07 PM

ReactJs came when there was a need of SPA ( Single page applications ).

React was introduced to make things which are easy to manage because there was no many interlinked tabs / buttons and it was confusing how data was actually flowing ? 

**Declarative nature of React**

There is a state which we have to maintain in Reactjs. We just change the state but not the DOM everytime.

**React Concepts**

1. Don’t Touch the DOM.
2. Works on the concept of reusable components.
    
    ex. Material UI
    
3. Unidirectional Data Flow 
    
    Our Application is build with a virtual DOM. ( State + Components + ... ). We change the State and DOM information change.
    
4. React is Everywhere. We can make Mobile apps with **React Native,** React VR apps , Desktop Apps with Electron and React , Terminal Application with react blast.

Decide on Components.

Decide the state and where it lives.

What changes when state changes.
